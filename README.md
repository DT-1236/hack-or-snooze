# "Hack-or-Snooze"

A jQuery project meant to showcase proficiency in classic JavaScript patterns - mainly the callback pattern. It draws heavily from the famed Hacker News

The app itself can be used with the file protocol, so after the repo is forked/cloned, index.html can simply be opened. The backend is hosted on Heroku's free tier, so it may take some time to show anything
