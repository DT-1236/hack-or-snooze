# "Hack-or-Snooze"

A jQuery project meant to showcase proficiency in classic JavaScript patterns - mainly the callback pattern. It draws heavily from the famed Hacker News

The backend is hosted on Heroku's free tier, so it may take some time to show anything. The app itself can be used with the file protocol, so after the repo is forked/cloned, index.html can simply be opened

## Prerequisites
